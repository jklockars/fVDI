For the ARAnyM driver:
 Ensure the wk->screen.pixel.* values are setup from the actual fvdi.sys
 values in any setup_wk() call.
 The problem was that the setup_wk() used to selfmodify the value based
 on the ones got from common driver init() method. The method setup_wk()
 is called twice however before the open_wk().
