Basic ft2 bitmap font support (tested with MS Win .fon fonts).
Performed tests of type-1 as well as TrueType fonts.

A few implementaiton notes:

  particular font->size were loaded
* font->flags & 0x8000 is FreeType2 handled font flag
* font->flags & 0x4000 is scalable font flag

For the ARAnyM driver:
 Ensure the wk->screen.pixel.* values are setup from the actual fvdi.sys
 values in any setup_wk() call.

 on the ones got from common driver init() method. The method setup_wk()
 is called twice however before the open_wk().
