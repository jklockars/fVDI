code for bitmap fonts which is #if 0 as it crashes for unknown
reason to me.

2006-12-08 - standa
Save some more registers in vst_effects() and fVDI runs in TOS4.04
again here.
Ft2 module is more FreeType2 library error agnostic now. For example
if the glyph doesn't render nothing is displayed, but it should not
crash the application anymore.
More 2.1.10 vs. 2.2.1 changes (read the migration notes this time ;).
Added the 'mrproper' target which does 'make clean' and also removes
all FT2 related .o/.a files. 

2006-12-04 - johan
Changed to the latest stable release of FreeType (2.2.1).

2006-11-29 - standa
Hopefully NVDI compatible spdchar.map handling now in place. Default
NVDI mapping added. Can use our 'Czech KEYBCS' spdchar.map table
with no problem. IMHO 98% of character mappings should be correct.

ft2_ftsystem.c to get FreeType2 2.2.1 build working.

2006-11-27 - johan

2006-11-15 - standa
Underline effect doesn't need to keep a font glyph cached (done in the
text rendering function directly.
Fontextra.ref_count introduced to fix fundamental Fontheader memory 
management bug that must have been causing crashes and rendering
errors because of use of unallocated memory.

2006-11-13 - standa
Some vertical font alignment tuning. Still not completely right IMHO.

2006-11-12 - standa
Implementing algorithmic FreeType font vst_effects() algorithms.
Left the 'outline' for later.

2006-07-14 - standa

directly to UNICODE when NVDI >4.0 is available. Highwire displays
everything nicely again.
Initial spdchar.map load implemented. Will test and enable later on.
Warning! The Virtual vwk structure has changed! Recompile all the drivers!

2006-02-27 - standa
Virtual* propagated into all FT2 functions as they need DPI information
eventually.
Font ID is now an adjusted family_name+style_name hashcode (stays the
same if you add a font to your setup - if doesn't conflict with any
previously added font).

kernel says PRIVILEGE VIOLATION if the cookie structure address
space is accessed (utility.c).
Bconout option implementation: redirects Bconout(con) output
to puts(), from the moment the physical screen workstation is opened,

Added a bitplane driver written in C, based on a significantly modified
version of the EmuTOS VDI blit routines. Definitely needs more work,
but it can at least display a desktop (sort of ;-)
