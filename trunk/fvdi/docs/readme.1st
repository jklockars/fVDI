Please, read the FVDI.TXT file for information on how to setup fVDI.
It is generally _not_ possible to run fVDI without copying some files
to other locations and modifying FVDI.SYS.

Note that I've not really put much effort into updating the included
documentation. There may also be some errors.

If you have any problems, questions etc, don't hesitate to email.
