I'm interested in any bug reports or comments on the drivers.

The drivers may currently have problems with virtual screen modes.
fVDI has only been reasonably well tested under TOS on a Falcon+AB040.


1plane.sys
Should work in normal Atari monochrome modes and on some graphics cards.
Accelerates everything currently supported by fVDI except filled polygons.

4plane.sys
Should work in any normal Atari 16 colour mode.
Also accelerates everything except filled polygons.
All normal blits are done in solid mode and there's only black and white
text, mono-expand blits and patterned fills. Solid fills are OK.

16bit.sys  (Not included with v0.95)
Works in Falcon true colour mode and possibly on some graphics cards.
Accelerates the most important things. Almost the entire driver is written
in relatively unoptimized C, however, so the speed is not nearly what it
could be for some functions.

rage.sys
Only works on the Eclipse/RageII.
Accelerates (in hardware) everything except fonts of other widths than
6/8 pixels. Screen->RAM blits can be cached (which will be very fast, but
not compatible with all software), turned on (only with pcibios) or turned
off (which will be fast but has obvious problems).
The same driver deals with 8, 16 and 32 bit graphics modes.
