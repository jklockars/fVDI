This file mentions a few things that are not completely implemented in
the current version of fVDI. Don't expect this to be an exhaustive list,
but there's no point in reporting anything that's covered below as a bug.

Drivers
 Both bitplane ones
  Only horizontal and vertical lines can use XOR mode.
  No line patterns are supported.
  The mouse shape will wrap around from the right to the left edge.
 Monochrome
  Normal text clipping to the right is not done correctly.
 16 colour
  Text, icons, and patterned fills are black and white only.

Engine
 No text scaling is done.
 Thick lines don't get any circles in the corners.
 Polygon peripheries aren't drawn.
 The only marker that's supported is single pixel.
 v_opnbm doesn't work.
